    <div class="bio">
        <p>To describe myself in one word, I am a builder. </p>
        <p>I’m a Developer, Woodworker, a "Do-It-Yourselfer", and Adventuring Thinker. Driven by my curiosity, I continue to experiment... It’s an itch and the process keeps me motivated. Currently, I manage the network and communications for Broadway Baptist Church in Louisville, while gaining more experience in Web Development. </p>

        <p>Pushing my skills as a developer, I hope to find more ways to contribute and build with new technologies. With an interest in Bio-Tech, I aspire to bridge the gap further between technology and human interaction. </p>

        <p>At the end of the day it’s nice to “unplug”. When I’m not behind a computer, you will normally find me around a workbench. With a passion for traditional woodworking I continue to learn and hone my craft focusing on hand tools and furniture making. My goal is to keep trade skills from becoming another chapter in the history book. Learning and sharing what I can, you can follow the process on Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/3WireBuild" target="new">@3WireBuild.</a> </p>
